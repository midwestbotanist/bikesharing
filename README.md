## Background:

Bikesharing companies have been popping up in cities across the US. This has been a lucrative business as it helps to alleviate the need for vehicle travel - an issue in cities with large populations due to the amount of congestion the traffic creates on roads/streets, particularly during morning and evening rush hours. Aside from improving traffic conditions by helping to remove the number of cars driving daily, this also can prove to be much cheaper transport for residents as it removes the costs for vehicular upkeep (fuel, carwash, insurance, parking, etc...). 

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the pros/cons of creating a bikesharing program in Des Moines, IA. 
### When implementing such a program, it is important to know:

* Typical trip duration times
* Total number of trips taken daily every hour for every day of the week, for all riders and then also with the gender comparison
* Total number of trips taken when comparing user type and gender for each day of the week

### The deliverables of this analysis are:

1) Change trip duration to a datetime format
2) Create visualizations for the trip analysis
3) Create a story and report for the final presentation (to be presented to the investors)


## Conclusions:
Bikesharing programs are cost-friendly and great solutions for improving congested city traffic. However, some things for the investors to keep in mind:
* Des Moines, IA already has a bikesharing program with 27 stations and 200 classic/e-bike options: https://desmoines.bcycle.com/. Below is the BCycle station map, further analysis should be conducted to determine whether additional stations and bikes would be of good investment
